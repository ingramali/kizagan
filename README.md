## SETUP

Firstly, you must need a windows computer.Because we don't want to encounter any errors while converting Python to exe.For server you can use linux or windows it doesn't matter.But we must need windows to conversion process.So execute the following command :

+ python setup.py

## USAGE

1. If you want to put icon to your trojan, go to internet and find a icon.Then download to kizagan-main directory.(or you can convert png, jpg file to .ico file)

2. If you want to combine a file with trojan, go to internet and find a file you wanted.Then download to kizagan-main directory.

3. Execute the builder.py to convert python file to windows executable file.

+ -ip = Set the ip address for reverse connection.

+ -p = Set the port number for reverse connection.

+ -i = Set the icon for trojan if you wanted.

+ -f = Set the combine file for trojan if you wanted.

4. Wait for conversion process.

5. When its done, you can see the executable file in the 'dist' folder.And from now it's up to you.So send this file to victim(via mail etc.) and wait for opens the file.

6. Let's say victim opened the trojan.When trojan opened, our combine file will open up.And our trojan is executed background.
